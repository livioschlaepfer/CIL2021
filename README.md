# CIL2021

Welcome!

This is the Git Repo of Livio Schl√§pfer, Mathias Rouss and Sven Kohler containing the code to reproduce our results for Project 3 ("Road Segmentation") which was completed within the scope of the Computational Intelligence Lab 2021.

## High profile explanation of the different files
- runner_training.py: Execute to train selected configuration
- runner_test.py: Execute to produce prediction for the selected configuration
- mask_to_submission.py: Execute to translate image prediction into uploadable Kaggle submission
- massa.py: Execute to prepare Massachusetts Road Dataset for pretraining and mixed training
- source folder (src):
    - criterion: folder which holds the implementations of the different loss functions
    - models: folder which holds the files to initialize the different models used in our experiments
    - dataset.py: creates datasets and data loaders
    - edge.py: canny edge detector
    - paths.py: holds the dictionaries with all the relevant paths
    - scheduler.py: different learning rate scheduler
    - seed.py: seeding function to ensure reproducability
    - tester.py: function which defines the whole testing process
    - trainer.py function which defines the whole training process
    - transform_test.py: defines transformations which are performed at test time
    - transforms.py: defines transformations which are performed at train time
    - visualizer.py: framework to visually keep track of training progress

## Data preparation
Before trying to reproduce our results, please arrange the pretraining, training and test data as instructed below.
First the user has to complete the missing folder paths in paths.py:
